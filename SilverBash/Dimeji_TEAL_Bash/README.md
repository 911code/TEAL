### This is a Simple Python - TEAL Smart Contract

Algorand Smart Contracts are implemented using a new language that is stack-based, called Transaction Execution Approval Language (TEAL). However, TEAL is essentially an assembly language. With PyTeal, developers can express smart contract logic purely using Python. PyTeal provides high level, functional programming style abstractions over TEAL and does type checking at construction time.

The choice-swap.py file is responsible for sending out an asset(preferably choice coin) from one address (which is uniquely generated from the generateAddress.py file) to another. 
To run this code effectively, 
`activate a virtual environment` 

`pip install pyteal`

                    OR

`pip install git+https://github.com/algorand/pyteal`
(that's all you need to get started... )

Transactions are between the sender(address1) and the reciever(address2)
